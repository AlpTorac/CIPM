Installation
====

The latest stable version of SPLevo can be installed from the stable update site:<br>
https://sdqweb.ipd.kit.edu/eclipse/splevo/releases/stable

For the latest nightly builds, you can use the nightly update site:<br>
https://sdqweb.ipd.kit.edu/eclipse/splevo/nightly


The update site provides access to:

* The SPLevo Core
* Technology Cartridges
* Feature Model Catridges
* (SPLevo Utiltities)

The later provides access to a small tool called SPLevo Metrics View but is not required to use SPLevo.
The only technology cartridge available so far, is the JaMoPP Java Catridge which you should installed because there is no reasonable thing to do without any technology supported at all.
