SPLevo Tests
============

This test plugin provides common test infrastructure and an integration test at the same time.

SPLevo consists of a processing chain. This test plugin provides:
a) an integrated test of the processing chain.
b) infrastructure for processing steps to load the result of previous 
	processing steps without implementing their execution on their own.
