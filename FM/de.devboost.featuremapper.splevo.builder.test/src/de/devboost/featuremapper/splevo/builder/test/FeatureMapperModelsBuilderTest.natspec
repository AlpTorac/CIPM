Objective of FeatureMapper Models Builder:

	The FeatureMapper Models Builder transforms a given SPLevo 
	Variation Point Model to a feature model and a 
	mapping model for FeatureMapper

If there is for example a variation point model named VPM1
	With a variation point PointP 
		That has a variant A mapped to class ExampleClassA in resource ClassA_Resource
		That has a variant B mapped to class ExampleClassB  in resource ClassB_Resource
		
	With a variation point PointP2 
		That has a variant C mapped to class ExampleClassC in resource ClassC_Resource
	
Then the FeatureMapper Models Builder generates
	A Feature Model
		With a root feature RootFeature
			With 2 child features named PointP and PointP2
		With feature PointP that contains 2 child features named PointP_A and PointP_B 
		With feature PointP2 that contains 0 children
				
	A Mapping Model
		With solution space model ClassA_Resource
		With solution space model ClassB_Resource
		With a mapping of feature PointP_A to ExampleClassA
		With a mapping of feature PointP_B to ExampleClassB
